    "text": "This is a blog post about Log Gaussian Cox Processes (LGCP). These are a type of point process models incorporating a Gaussian Random Field. Doing so allows us to take into account spatial or temporal correlation across our region. Statistically, this is quite an advantageous improvement from the Poisson Point Process. However, the inclusion of the random field presents mathematical and computational challenges. We will address some of these here and cover the basic state of the literature regarding these problems .",

See (camelitti-2013?) to set up the pieces for the spatial-temporal covariance bits.\nIn the Poisson Point Process the intensity is written as \\[\n\\lambda(s) = \\theta(s)b(s) = \\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s) + \\gamma + \\delta'z(s)]\n\\] In the LGCP we now incorporate a Gaussian Random Field to incorporate spatial correlation between sites \\[\n\\lambda(s) = \\theta(s)b(s) = \\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s) + \\gamma + \\delta'z(s) + w(s)]\n\\] so that the expected value for quadrat \\(A\\) will be the integral over the quadrat: \\[\n\\Delta(A) = \\int_A\\lambdabda(s)ds = \\int_A \\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s) + \\gamma + \\delta'z(s) + w(s)]ds\n\\]\nHowever, this forces to use a covariance structure that grows in size as the area of interest increases in area. Thus, the computational complexity to estimate such covariance structure as \\(n\\) increases makes this approach inhibitively costly for large regions. Using MCMC to estimate this model is possible, but slow.\nIntegrated Nested Laplace Approximations have been proposed by (rue-2009?) as a fast way to estimate LGCPs.\n\n3 Covariance Matrices",

The GRMF representation allows the use of a sparese matrix represesntation of the covariance structure.\nThey additionally provide a triangulation of the spatial region for approximation of the process likelihood. Basically, just approximate the density of the spatial process with triangulation in space using a set of basis functions\n\\[\nu(s) = \\sum^m_{k=1}\\psi_k(s)w_k\n\\] with \\(\\psi_k(s)\\) basis functions and gaussian weights \\(w_k\\).\nThis approach can be implemented in the INLA framework.",
