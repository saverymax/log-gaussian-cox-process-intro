    "text": "This is a blog post about Log Gaussian Cox Processes (LGCP). These are a type of point process models incorporating a Gaussian Random Field. Doing so allows us to take into account spatial or temporal correlation across our region. Statistically, this is quite an advantageous improvement from the Poisson Point Process. However, the inclusion of the random field presents mathematical and computational challenges. We will address some of these here and cover the basic state of the literature regarding these problems .",

From the Moraga tutorial above, she says the continuous process is estimated using a weighted average of the process at the vertices of the discrete triangulation mesh.\nThe projection matrix maps the GMRF from the observations to the triangulation nodes. The observation will be the weighted average using the weights and values from the triangulation and projection matrix. \\[\nS(x_i) \\approx \\sum^G_{g=1}A_{ig}S_g\n\\]\nSimpson 2016",

    "text": "3.3 SPDE\nCameletti (2013) has a implementation of SPDE and does a nice job describing the theory in an introductory but not basic way.\nThe innovation of the SPDE approach is to develop a GRMF that represents the matern covariance structure, so that inference inherits the faster computational properties of the GFMF and does not suffer the computational cost due to increasing the size of the spatial region and thus the covariance matrix computations.\nLindgren 2011 find that a GF with matern covariance structure is a solution to a SPDE. The GRMF representation allows the use of a sparese matrix represesntation of the covariance structure.\nThey additionally provide a triangulation of the spatial region for approximation of the process likelihood. Basically, just approximate the density of the spatial process with triangulation in space using a set of basis functions\n\\[\nu(s) = \\sum^m_{k=1}\\psi_k(s)w_k\n\\] with \\(\\psi_k(s)\\) basis functions and gaussian weights \\(w_k\\).\nThis approach can be implemented in the INLA framework.",
