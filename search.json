Doing so allows us to take into account spatial or temporal correlation across our region. Statistically, this is quite an advantageous improvement from the Poisson Point Process. However, the inclusion of the random field presents mathematical and computational challenges. We will address some of these here and cover the basic state of the literature regarding these problems .",

    "text": "2.1 INLA\nA Poisson point process is a stochastic set of random variables in 2D space. The LGCP is a version of this incorporates spatial and potentially temporal correlation into a model for this point process, including the number of points in the spatial domain and the locations of the points.\nSee (camelitti-2013?) to set up the pieces for the spatial-temporal covariance bits.\nFinish augmenting notes with: https://www.paulamoraga.com/book-spatial/sec-geostatisticaldataSPDE.html and https://becarioprecario.bitbucket.io/spde-gitbook\nIn the Poisson Point Process the intensity is written as \\[\n\\lambda(s) = \\theta(s)b(s) = \\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s) + \\gamma + \\delta'z(s)]\n\\] In the LGCP we now incorporate a Gaussian Random Field to incorporate spatial correlation between sites \\[\n\\lambda(s) = \\theta(s)b(s) = \\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s) + \\gamma + \\delta'z(s) + w(s)]\n\\] so that the expected value for quadrat \\(A\\) will be the integral over the quadrat: \\[\n\\Delta(A) = \\int_A\\lambda(s)ds = \\int_A \\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s) + \\gamma + \\delta'z(s) + w(s)]ds\n\\]\nHowever, this forces to use a covariance structure that grows in size as the area of interest increases in area. Thus, the computational complexity to estimate such covariance structure as \\(n\\) increases makes this approach inhibitively costly for large regions. Using MCMC to estimate this model is possible, but slow.\nIntegrated Nested Laplace Approximations have been proposed by (rue-2009?) as a fast way to estimate LGCPs. Follow https://www.paulamoraga.com/book-spatial/sec-geostatisticaldataSPDE.html, we define \\[\nY_i|S(s_i) \\sim N(\\mu + S(s_i), \\tau^2), i=1,...,n.\n\\] Here \\(\\mu\\) is a constant effect and \\(S(s_i)\\) refers to the spatial field.\nThe SPDE approach represents the continuous Gaussian Field with a discretely indexed Gaussian Markov Random Field, using a basis function defined on a triangulation of the region of interest.\nFrom https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tdb5EPczE9E&ab_channel=TomislavHengl%28OpenGeoHubFoundation%29 and https://www.paulamoraga.com/book-geospatial/sec-geostatisticaldatatheory.html.

The GRMF representation allows the use of a sparese matrix represesntation of the covariance structure.\nThey additionally provide a triangulation of the spatial region for approximation of the process likelihood. Basically, just approximate the density of the spatial process with triangulation in space using a set of basis functions\n\\[\nu(s) = \\sum^m_{k=1}\\psi_k(s)w_k\n\\] with \\(\\psi_k(s)\\) basis functions and gaussian weights \\(w_k\\).\nThis approach can be implemented in the INLA framework.",
