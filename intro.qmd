# Introduction

This is a blog post about Log-Gaussian Cox Processes (LGCP). It is a follow up to the earlier blog post I made about Poisson Point Process models. In fact, the LGCP is an extension of the Poisson Point Process, in that a latent correlation structure is included in the point process model. Specifically, the LGCP uses a Gaussian Random Field to characterize the intensity of the point process. Doing so allows us to take into account spatial or temporal correlation across our region or period of interest. 

Statistically,  this is quite an advantageous improvement from the Poisson Point Process where spatial correlation could only be accounted for via covariates. However, the inclusion of the random field presents mathematical and computational challenges. We will address these challenges here, making use of the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach.
