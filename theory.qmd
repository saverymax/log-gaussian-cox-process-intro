# LGCP theory

The LGCP incorporates ...

In the Poisson Point Process the intensity is written as
$$
\lambda(s) = \theta(s)b(s) = \exp[\alpha + \beta'x(s) + \gamma + \delta'z(s)]
$$
In the LGCP we now incorporate a Gaussian Random Field to incorporate spatial correlation between sites
$$
\lambda(s) = \theta(s)b(s) = \exp[\alpha + \beta'x(s) + \gamma + \delta'z(s) + w(s)]
$$
so that the expected value for quadrat $A$ will be the integral over the quadrat:
$$
\Delta(A) = \int_A\lambda(s)ds = \int_A \exp[\alpha + \beta'x(s) + \gamma + \delta'z(s) + w(s)]ds
$$

However, this forces to use a covariance structure that grows in size as the area of interest increases in area. Thus, the computational complexity
to estimate such covariance structure as $n$ increases makes this approach inhibitively costly for large regions.
