To install the R-INLA package, run "install.packages("INLA",repos=c(getOption("repos"),INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)"

Here we are going to cover the basics of the log-Gaussian Cox Process (INLA), it's approximation using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation, and the application of this model to Presence-Only point pattern modelling.

There are many good references, as this is a somewhat trendy model in ecology.
